DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle while delivering high-quality software. Git branching is a powerful feature in Git that allows developers to work on multiple versions of a project simultaneously. It enables collaboration, experimentation, and efficient management of code changes, making it an essential tool in DevOps workflows.
